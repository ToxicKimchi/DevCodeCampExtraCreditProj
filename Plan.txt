You are Hercules, the greatest of the Greek Heroes! You have been tasked by King Eurystheus to slay the vicious Nemean Lion,
defeat the impossible nine-headed Lernaean Hydra, and capture the guard dog of the underworld—Cerberus.

Features:  
As a developer, I want to make at least five commits with descriptive messages. 
    -Github
As a user, I want an engaging story to be told using alerts. 
    -Permission granted to find a different way, thinking a scrolling persistent message box
As a user, I want Hercules (and each enemy), to have health, attack power, and an array of attack names saved in an object literal.
    -current thought is to have a nested data-dictionary for the attacks w/ their corresponding attack power. 
    -In future iterations, look at using a constructor to allow for dynamic creation of enemies.
        - Supposedly a combo of (var) = null; or (var) = undefined; followed by a delete(var); will cause a variable to no longer exist, 
        allowing for dynamic creation and deletion. 
As a user, I want the ability to select Hercules’ attack using a menu prompt.
    - Current idea is a menu similar to pokemon, with buttons. Though it may follow a FF format instead.
As a user, I want the foe’s attack to be chosen at random.
    - Do a count of the size of their attack dictionary, and use a random number generator to pick one of their indexes.
As a user, I want the results of each attack to be logged in the console. 
    - Console log it, and maybe a separate "combat" log tab in the persistent message box.
As a developer, I want to use an Attack() function that will terminate when Hercules or an enemy’s health reaches zero. 
    - Attack will essentially be the "battle" phase.
As a developer, I want my RunGame() function to call my other functions in a logical order that will determine game flow.
    - Initial will be a single class; if time in future, break into multiple: actions and character creation.
As a developer, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function should do just one thing! 
    - NO GOD FUNCTIONS!
